Prior to Pinestar
After years of living in the Forest, SkyClan was unable to stay. Underneath Cloudstar's leadership, their territory was taken over by twolegs, and none of the other clans wanted to help them, thus they left the clans, leaving only a few cats behind to live with the other clans. Over the next few years, SkyClan would completely fall apart, Spiderstar being the leader who decided SkyClan could not live on as a clan any longer.
In ThunderClan, a she-cat named Mapleshade and her kits were banished for breaking one of the rules: having a mate in a different clan, resulting in a series of unfortunate deaths caused by this she-cat gone mad. She too died, which resulted in the later uprising of The Place of No Stars.
A few moons would pass, and the first known cat to be trained by this Dark Forest cat would be born, namely Goosefeather. However, Goosefeather eventually managed to resist her manipulation, and cut ties with her.
Prior to Firestar
Pinestar took leadership over in ThunderClan, he would get interested in kittypet life over the years that he lead, and would eventually decide to become a kittypet himself after the birth of his only surviving child, Tigerkit. This resulted in the creation of a 15th rule forbiding the acceptance of kittypet life.
Before that though, 4 important cats were born. Those being Yellowfang from ShadowClan, Bluefur of ThunderClan, Talltail from WindClan and Crookedjaw from RiverClan.
Talltail would lose his father in a landslide, and would leave the clans in search of revenge for the cat who lead his father into that landslide. He'd meet a kittypet named Jake while doing so, and would eventually come back, becoming the WindClan deputy, as well as the next leader.
Crookedjaw was the second known cat to be manipulated by Mapleshade, unlike Goosefeather, he got manipulated more and more. She eventually made him become leader, likely planning on using him in some way, but he eventually managed to get out of her grip.
Bluefur too would manage to become a great warrior. She'd have kits with a RiverClan cat, but deciding to give them to her mate so that she could become the next deputy and leader.
Yellowfang would give birth to Brokenkit, despite being a medicine cat. Brokenkit would eventually become the ruthless ruler Brokenstar, who would do things such as steal kits and train them at a young age, often resulting in their deaths.
While all this is going on, a kittypet named Tiny is born in Twolegplace. He'll eventuallyrename himself Scourge, and create the rogue group known as BloodClan.
At some point, another kittypet is born, namely Rusty, and he'd decide to visit the clans. Due to a prophecy saying "fire would save the clan", Bluestar of ThunderClan decides to allow him to join her clan under the name of Firepaw. The ThunderClan deputy, Redtail, is unexpectedly killed the day he joins. It's believed he was killed by a RiverClan cat, though he was in fact killed by Tigerclaw, Pinestar's son, no one but Firepaw, Ravenpaw and Graypaw know this though. Brokenstar manages to drive WindClan out of their territory during Firepaw's training, and a fight breaks out between Thunder and ShadowClan when some kits are stolen, resulting in the defeat of the cruel leader. Yellowfang joins ThunderClan, becoming their medicine cat after their previous one was killed by ShadowClan. Firepaw gets made a warrior, and his best friend, Graystripe, falls in love with a RiverClan cat. Another fight takes place with the now banished Brokenstar, and he gets captured and held prisoner by ThunderClan, later dying there as well. WindClan is also returned home, Fireheart and Tallstar forming a close bond too.
Tigerclaw, now deputy, tries to kill Bluestar so he can take over the clan, but fails and is banished for his actions. This drives Bluestar mad. Graystripe decides to change clans so he can care for his newborn kits, and Fireheart gets made deputy. Tigerclaw manages to become the leader of ShadowClan as the clan was weakened due to illness, and he'd eventually try to lure dogs to ThunderClan, hoping they would kill them all. The dogs would eventually lead to Bluestar's death, who died defeating them. Making Fireheart the new leader.
Firestar's leadership
Firestar recieves his nine lives, and is officially made leader of ThunderClan. He's training Bramblepaw, who happens to be Tigerstar's son, and tries his best to undo the things Bluestar did in her madness. Graystripe also comes back to ThunderClan
Meanwhile, Tigerstar is trying to form allagiances with RiverClan, and their new leader Leopardstar, and WindClan. Leopardstar agrees on joining him, and together they form a new clan, TigerClan, while Tallstar refuses the offer. Tigerstar eventually decides to ask BloodClan for help as well, and plans an attack on Thunder and WindClan, who'd formed an allagiance of their own, resembling Lionclan. However, in a twist of events, Tigerstar is killed by the BloodClan leader, who'd had some kind of unfinished buisness from his kithood with the leader. Scourge calls war on the four clans, and a battle takes place not too long after. Firestar defeats Scourge, and the clans go back to their own respectful lives. ShadowClan now being underneath the leadership of Blackstar.
Firestar gets a message from StarClan, and is send out on a journey with his mate, Sandstorm. They were given the secret task of finding the remains of SkyClan and rebuilding it, which they manage to do in the span of a few moons, allowing them to live underneath Leafstar before returning back home.
While they were away, Graystripe, the deputy, temporarily lead ThunderClan, during this time, he and his clan had trouble with the remains of BloodClan, who wanted vengeance for the death of their leader.
Meanwhile in RiverClan, a cat named Sasha and her kits, Hawk and Moth, join. She eventually reveals Hawk and Moth are the now dead Tigerstar's kits, and leaves to be a rogue again, leaving her two kits to become RiverClan warriors.
After Firestar's return, he and Sandstorm get two kittens, Squirrelkit and Leafkit.
Around this time, Onewhisker from WindClan starts seeing a she-cat kittypet named Smoke. He breaks up their relationship fairly shortly after, but she still became pregnant with his kits, and gave birth to Darkkit.
One cat from each clan gets a message from StarClan, asking them to find Midnight. These cats are Brambleclaw from ThunderClan, Tawnypelt from ShadowClan (Bramble's sister, left ThunderClan as an apprentice to live with her father), Feathertail from RiverClan (one of Graystripe's kits) and Crowpaw from WindClan. They leave on a journey to try and figure out what StarClan wants, Squirrelpaw from ThunderClan and Stormfur from RiverClan, (Graystripe's other kit) join too. They eventually find out Midnight is a badger, and she tells them their old home will be destroyed, and the need to lead the clans to a new home.
Meanwhile in the clans, this destruction is visiable. ShadowClan has the most trouble, with RiverClan the least. Several cats start dissapearing, being taken away by twolegs. Among these were Leafpaw and Mistyfoot (RiverClan's deputy). Firestar moves camp, and he and Blackstar eventually team up, as well as Tallstar, trying to survive their situation.
On their way back home, the traveling cats meet the Tribe of Rushing Waters, and are forced to help them get rid of a mountain lion that's been hunting them. Feathertail dies during this mission, and the group goes back home without her.
Back in the clans, the cats give forth their message, and eventually convince all clans to move. Crowpaw gets his warrior name, Crowfeather, and the cats that were taken by twolegs get saved, though Graystripe is kidnapped instead, leaving ThunderClan without a deputy.
After a long journey, the clans settle near a lake, the same lake the ancients used to live by. Squirrelpaw gets made Squirrelflight, and she starts dating Brambleclaw. Tallstar dies, and appoints Onewhisker to be his deputy last-minute, this is unknown to Mudclaw, his previous deputy, and a fight breaks out between the two, resulting in Mudclaw's death, and Onewhisker becoming Onestar.
Leafpaw finds the moonpool, the equivalent to the Moonstone in this new territory, and is made into a full medicine cat named Leafpool.
Brambleclaw and Hawlfrost start training with their dead father, growing closer as brothers in the meantime, this upsets Squirrelflight, who doesn't trust Hawkfrost, and she breaks up with Bramble.
Leafpool gets into a forbidden relationship with Crowfeather, and the two attempt to run away, but are forced to come back when badgers attack Thunderclan, and Leafpool is now the only medicine cat of her clan. She breaks up with Crowfeather.
Squirrelflight gets close with Ashfur, but realises she doesn't love him, and rejects his request to be mates. Meanwhile, Brambleclaw is made deputy, and he and Squirrelflight get back together not too long after. Hawkfrost tries to kill Firestar, so Brambleclaw can become leader, but he stops his half-brother, killing him instead.
In SkyClan, The cats are having a rat problem, but it eventually gets resolved. Leafstar allows kittypets to join her clan, and makes them "daylight warriors", they only live with the clan during the day. She also gets pregnant, and meets a cat named Sol, who joins SkyClan, but is forced to leave not too long after due to continues breaking of the code and bringing the clan in danger.
Some time later, it turns out Leafpool had gotten pregnant with Crowfeather's kits, and she asks her sister to help her deliver the kits somehwere where the clans don't know. Squirrelflight eventually decides to take care of the kits, knowing Leafpool isn't allowed to, and adopts them as her's and Brambleclaw's.
Hollypaw, Lionpaw and Jaypaw eventually become apprentices of ThunderClan. Even though Holly started off as a med cat apprentice, and Jay as a warrior's, the two switched places. Jaypaw finds out that he and his siblings are part of a prephecy, and should have powers. He realises he can read minds and walk into other cat's dreams, though he does not yet tell his siblings. Graystripe manages to find his way back to ThunderClan with his new mate, Millie, though decides that Brambleclaw should stay deputy. Lionpaw starts seeing a WindClan she-cat, as well as starts training with tigerstar and Hawkfrost in the dark forest. He finds some tunnels that are locate dunderneath Thunder and WindClan. Jaypaw finds them too, and meets Rock, he also gets wraped into a flash back of Fallen Leaves' death. He later finds out he's a reincarnation of Jay's Wing, as he goes back in time to creat the tribe. Lionpaw breaks up with the WindClan apprentice, and not too long after, all three of them travel to the mountains. The tribe wants their help with some strong hostile cats that have been demanding their land. Jaypaw realises Lionpaw is unbeatable, and tells his siblings about the prophecy. After they return back home, Hollypaw notices a strage cat. This turns out to be Sol.
Sol tells them about the solar eclipse, which happens during a battle between all four clans. This makes Blackstar trust Sol, and he takes over ShadowClan. Tawnypelt and her new family flee to live in ThunderClan, saying ShadowClan has abandoned the warrior code and their ancestors. With the help of Tawnypelt's kits, Holly, Lion and Jay manage to make Blackstar believe in StarClan again, resulting in Sol leaving ShadowClan. Lionpaw also stops his Dark forest training around now.
Not too long after, they're made warriors, and a fire breaks out. Jayfeather gets trapped due to being blind and not being able to find a way out of the fire. Hollyleaf, Lionblaze and Squirrelflight stay behind to help him, but Squirrelflight is too weak from the battle, and can't get her adopted kits out of the fire. Ashfur comes in to help them, but stops, saying he wants to hurt Squirrelflight for rejecting him, so she must watch her kits die. She tells them about having adopted the kits, resulting in all of them getting out.
Ashfur is found dead a few days later, and WindClan gets accused of murder. As no culprits were found, Sol gets accused instead, though manages to escape before being punished. Hollyleaf finds out who her real parents are and gets upset, revealing the secret in front of all the clans, thretening to kill Leafpool, and then flees, getting stuck in a mudslide. It turns out she had killed Ashfur, though this secret is kept from the clans. Brambleclaw also decides to break up with Squirrelflight because she held the truth about the kit's parents from him.
Though she's assumed to have died, she actually survived and lived in the tunnels for the next few moons, being brought back to health by Fallen Leaves Spirit.
Two new kits are made apprentices, Dovepaw and Ivypaw, and Jayfeather realises Dovepaw was the third cat from the prophecy, not Hollyleaf. So he and Lionblaze decide to train her. She can see and hear things that happen far away, and notices some beavers taking away the water. She goes on a journey to stop the dam from being made and bring back the water. She and Tigerheart from ShadowClan get closer, and eventaully start dating. She also notices Leopardstar's illness, which results in her death, leaving Mistystar to take over. Mistystar demotes her medicine cat, Mothwing, for not believing in StarClan.
Meanwhile Ivypaw gets jealous of Dovepaw's attention, and is lured into the dark forest, where she starts training with Hawkfrost. She finds out she's not the only cat training there, and that Tigerstar is trying to unite the dark forest for some reason.
Around this time, Flametail from ShadowClan dies. And Jayfeather is accused of his death, thus gets demoted. Ivypaw finds out Tigerheart is training in the dark forest too, and notices his closeness to her sister.
Eventually, ivypaw and Dovepaw confront each other, Ivypaw reveals she's training in the dark forest, and Dovepaw reveals her part in some prophecy. Ivypaw, now understanding what's going on, decides to spy on the dark forest.
She has to kill one of the ex-apprentices that recently became a full dark forest member to prove she too is ready to become a dark forest warrior. So Ivypaw, now Ivypool, does exactly this. Dovewing finds out about Tigerheart being in the dark forest, and thinks he is using her, so she breaks up with him.
Ivypool and Dovewing get stuck in the tunnels, and Hollyleaf helps them get out, rejoining ThunderClan in te process. Sol makes a brief appearance, trying to set WindClan against ThunderClan, but is stopped and defeated, fleeing, never to be seen again. Mothwing and Jayfeather both get their position as med cat back
